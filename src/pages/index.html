    <p>Navgurukul offers a fully-funded skilling program in software engineering with guaranteed job to youth from low-income families. The program is for one year and is a residential course.</p>
    <p>Our students come from different parts of the country and are the first person to get higher education in their families and communities, first person to learn technology driven modern skills and get aspirational jobs. The program and its pedagogy
      are focused on nourishing changemakers and free thinkers who would become the light of change in their own communities once they grow professionally.</p>
    <p>When one person steps out of their community to achieve their dreams, she becomes an inspiration to many. Thus, at Navgurukul, we are committed to taking our program to as many communities as possible.</p>
    <p>Our partners help us give access to aspirational careers to youth who want to grow but don’t have means to do so. Our partnerships are the backbone of our operations.</p>
    <p>Our partners share our values, our partners share our impact.</p>

    <p>If you are an organisation or an individual who works with youth and/or in education, we have a great potential to collaborate.</p>
    <p>Our partners motivate and inform their communities about our software engineering program and its benefits. They identify youth who could use this opportunity and conduct the admissions test for them if needed.</p>
    <p>We support our partners in this mobilization process by understanding the needs of the youth in their community, offering them content for information sessions and admissions tests. </p>
    <p>Once the students are selected with the help of any partner, we offer the progress reports of the students to the partner and help them share their inspirational stories in their impact reports and talks. </p>

          <p>
            Our students are equipped with skills to pursue aspirational jobs like software engineering. They choose to join the mainstream workforce or stay back in their communities and work remotely on opportunities which are made available to them. They become
            socio-economic centers in their families &amp; communities.

          <p>
            Our students use their skills to solve the problems that are plaguing their communities. From making simple apps to learn english to social network for farmers, there is a big role our alumni is playing to bring technology to their communities. Our alumni
            will be an inspiration and examples for locals to understand how learning &amp; opportunities are getting reinvented through Internet.
